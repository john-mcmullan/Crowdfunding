# Key Take Aways

1.	The arts are in the most need of funding with Theatre leading the way. While the rate of success remains the same. If starting an arts-based project be aware you will be entering a crowded field
2.	The failure rate of Video Games crowdfunding is higher than any other project. If starting a project in this field be aware that you will need to stand out to be successful.
3.	The worst times to start a crowdfunding is August, December and January which could be linked to the expenses undertaken by people with the start of school and the Christmas holidays being a burden on their pocketbook. It would be better to wait to start your project until people are more willing to donate.

# Limitations in Data

1.	Only has data from seven countries All Western European and North American with only Australia and China as the outliers. If starting a project in another country or region these conclusions might not hold true.
2.	No mention of what kind of crowd funding was done, was it in person fundraising or online, if online what website was used? There are multiple ways to start a project and depending on how you do it some of these conclusions may no longer be true.
3.	There is a smaller number of High-priced projects making the success rates unreliable. While we can draw some conclusions on bigger projects, the small amount provided in the data set means it could be inaccurate.

# Improvements to be made

1.	Amount of goal vs. Success rate. Creating a pivot table along with bar graph would show a correlation between amount asked and failure rates. Then filtering by category would show if certain categories were only more successful because they ask for less
2.	Length of funding vs. amount raised. It would determine if the longer projects always raised more. There are a couple of indicators that if you don’t hit your goal early, you’re not going to. Just looking at a sample id 0 raised 0% in two and a half weeks while id 1 raised 1040% in two days.
3.	I pivot table of success rates of spotlight projects and percent funded of spotlight projects. Is being in the spotlight worth it and does it show I great enough significance to make it worth the expense.
